Hi.

This is intended for use in an embedded Awesomium instance, though it'd be
cool to use it as a base for the Royale website when we get around to doing
that.

In the meantime, to preview it properly you'll probably need to either run it
on a server, or launch Chrome with the --allow-file-access-from-files flag.
