## HELLO.

This is the Arcade Royale launcher, a kiosk-mode app for presenting a list of
games in a pretty way. It's powered by [node-webkit][1] and dream and friends.

It's a bit light on documentation now, but check `settings.cson` in the project root and any of the `arcadedata.cson` files in the Games directory to find out how to configure the launcher for your use.
